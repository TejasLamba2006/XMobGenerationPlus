  default-mob-type: ZOMBIE
  default-spawn-count: 5
  default-respawn-delay: 30
  restart-interval: 10  # Time in minutes between area restarts
```

1. Use WorldEdit to select an area (using the wooden axe)
2. Create a spawn area using `/xmg create <n>`
3. Configure the area using the GUI or commands
4. Enable/disable spawning using the GUI
5. Configure custom drops and mob stats through the GUI

### MythicMobs Integration

To use MythicMobs in your spawn areas:

1. Install MythicMobs plugin (optional)
2. Use the format `mythic:mobtype` when configuring mob types
   Example: `/xmg config myarea mythic:CustomBoss 5 30`

Note: Version 1.7.0 and above will work perfectly fine without MythicMobs installed. The plugin will only enable MythicMobs features when the dependency is present.
